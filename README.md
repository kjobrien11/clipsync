# Clip Sync
easily create engaging videos by combining photos with a sound track!

what makes clip sync different than any other similar service is how it displays the pictures with the sound track. instead of placing them arbitrary, this project calculates the perfect position to place them so they will play in sync with the sound track provided. with multiple photo time division options, this project is great for anyone who wants to post picutre collages in a unique way whether it is a fast burst or slow highlight.

first, input the photo display time division and the BPM of the sound track you are syncing them with. next, if you don't want to start the song at the begining, input the time you want the soundtrack to start. finally, select the folder your pictures are stored and the file of the sound track. that's it, the program creates a .webm file you can play in a browser. 

this projects was created using python and the musicpy library.

for best results use files that are the same size.
